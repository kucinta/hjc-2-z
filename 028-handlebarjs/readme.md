# Handlebars.js

<http://handlebarsjs.com>

Handlebars (template system) provides the power necessary to let you build semantic templates effectively with no frustration. Handlebars is largely compatible with Mustache templates. In most cases it is possible to swap out Mustache with Handlebars and continue using your current templates.

Mustache is a logic-less template syntax. It can be used for HTML, config files, source code - anything. It works by expanding tags in a template using values provided in a hash or object.

Handlebars' custom helpers can be very useful, but often end up introducing logic into your templates. Mustache does not have custom helpers.

Mustache has interpreters in many languages, while Handlebars is Javascript only.

Another difference between them is the size of the file:

* Mustache.js has 18kb,
* Handlebars.js has 160kb
