Vue.js is optimized for DOM manipulation. Vue.js uses component driven model to manipulate document object model. VueJS do not require jQuery.

Vue.js is a more flexible, less opinionated solution. Vue.js has a much less complicated learning curve in comparison with AngularJS. Itâ€™s very easy for one to learn the ropes of Vue.js. It allows us to write simple JavaScript, as its source code is very readable.

Note: AngularJS is a full-blown framework, with lots of tools right of the box. It takes more time to get used to it than Vue.js. Vue.js is very flexible, and is probably considered a library instead of a framework. Vue.js does everything you need, in a simple, clean way. AngularJS is unnecessarily complicated and less powerful.

Learning Curve: Vue.js is easier to learn. If you know vanilla javascript.

Performance: Vue.js v2 is much faster as compared to AngularJS

Typical script with two-way data binding:

    <div id="app">
    <input type="text" v-model="message"/>
    <span>{{message}}</span>
    </div>
    <script>
    new Vue({
        el:'#app',data:''
    });
    <script>

ES2015 vs ES6

ES2015

    var salary = [10000, 20000, 30000];
    var with1000Increment = salary.map(x => x + 1000);
    console.log(with1000Increment);
    var name = "Arun";
    var user = {
        name, getAddress() {
            return "Colombo. Sri Lanka";
        }
    };

ES6

    "use strict";
    var salary = [10000, 20000, 30000];
    var with1000Increment = salary.map(function(x) {
        return x + 1000;
    });
    console.log(with1000Increment);
    var name = "Arun";
    var user = {
        name: name,
        getAddress: function getAddress() {
            return "Colombo. Sri Lanka";
        }
    };

Showing Variables:

    console.log(name);
    console.log(user.name);
    console.log(user.getAddress);
    var name = "Arunoda";
    var address = "Colombo, Sri Lanka";
    var greeting = `My Name is ${name} and I live in ${address}`;
    console.log(greeting);
