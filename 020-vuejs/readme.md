Vue.js is optimized for DOM manipulation. Vue.js uses component driven model to manipulate document object model. VueJS do not require jQuery.

Vue.js is a more flexible, less opinionated solution. Vue.js has a much less complicated learning curve in comparison with AngularJS. Itâ€™s very easy for one to learn the ropes of Vue.js. It allows us to write simple JavaScript, as its source code is very readable.

Note: AngularJS is a full-blown framework, with lots of tools right of the box. It takes more time to get used to it than Vue.js. Vue.js is very flexible, and is probably considered a library instead of a framework. Vue.js does everything you need, in a simple, clean way. AngularJS is unnecessarily complicated and less powerful.

Learning Curve: Vue.js is easier to learn. If you know vanilla javascript.

Performance: Vue.js v2 is much faster as compared to AngularJS

#### HTML

use router-link component for navigation. specify the link by passing the to prop. <router-link> will be rendered as an A tag by default. <router-view> is route outlet component matched by the route will render here.

```
<div id="app">
    <p>
    <router-link to="/foo">Go to Foo</router-link>
    <router-link to="/bar">Go to Bar</router-link>
    </p>
    <router-view></router-view>
</div>
```

#### Javascript

1 - Define route components. These can be imported from other files.
```
    const Foo = { template: '<div>foo</div>' }
    const Bar = { template: '<div>bar</div>' }
```
2 - Define some routes. Each route should map to a component. The "component" can either be an actual component constructor created via Vue.extend(), or just a component options object.
```
    const routes = [
    { path: '/foo', component: Foo },
    { path: '/bar', component: Bar }
    ]
```
3 - Create the router instance and pass the routes option. You can pass in additional options here.
```
    const router = new VueRouter({
        routes // short for routes: routes
    })
```
4 - Create and mount the root instance. Make sure to inject the router with the router option to make the whole app router-aware.
```
    var app = new Vue({
        router
    }).$mount('#app')
```
Now the app has started!

Typical script with two-way data binding:

    <div id="app">
    <input type="text" v-model="message"/>
    <span>{{message}}</span>
    </div>
    <script>
    new Vue({
        el:'#app',data:''
    });
    <script>

ES2015 vs ES6

ES2015

    var salary = [10000, 20000, 30000];
    var with1000Increment = salary.map(x => x + 1000);
    console.log(with1000Increment);
    var name = "Arun";
    var user = {
        name, getAddress() {
            return "Colombo. Sri Lanka";
        }
    };

ES6

    "use strict";
    var salary = [10000, 20000, 30000];
    var with1000Increment = salary.map(function(x) {
        return x + 1000;
    });
    console.log(with1000Increment);
    var name = "Arun";
    var user = {
        name: name,
        getAddress: function getAddress() {
            return "Colombo. Sri Lanka";
        }
    };

Showing Variables:

    console.log(name);
    console.log(user.name);
    console.log(user.getAddress);
    var name = "Arunoda";
    var address = "Colombo, Sri Lanka";
    var greeting = `My Name is ${name} and I live in ${address}`;
    console.log(greeting);
