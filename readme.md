This is my GitHub home page for learning to write better codes in [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5) (Hypertext Markup Language), [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#CSS_3) (Cascading Style Sheets) and JS [ES5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript#5th_Edition) (JavaScript).

My Learning Strategy here: HTML, CSS and JavaScript plus JSON

Projects here are divided into individual folders. Each project folder contains numerous html/css/js files related to that project.

> The project folder is named starts with a three digits (day of year) and (-) the short title of the project it holds.

## Getting Started

A GitHub account for storing and rendering static HTML, CSS and JS codes. Download and install the [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) on the personal computer. It provides an organised way to synchronize folders and files between the computer and the remote GitHub host. A simple text editor like [ATOM](https://atom.io), [Brackets](https://brackets.io), or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) to create and edit text files on the computer. Use [CodePen](https://codepen.io/pen/), a playground for the front end side of the web, to write and test HTML/CSS/JS Sniplets.

### Use GitHub Pages to "Demo" HTML/CSS/JS codes

* On the project root: <https://kucinta.github.io>
* Or on <https://github.kucinta.com/hjc-2-z> (remote backup)

> GitHub Pages is designed to host project pages directly from a GitHub repository. GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service and doesn't support server-side code such as, PHP, Ruby, or Python. **Other Limitations:** Github Pages does not permits data to be written back to the host by the javascripts.
